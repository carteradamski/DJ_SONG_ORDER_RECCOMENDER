# DJ Playlist Optimizer

I started learning to be a DJ. Realized it sounded better to mix songs that had similar BPMs and keys. Made this program to take the songs you want to listen to and then it gives an optimal order to play the songs to have seamless transitions.

## How It Works

This web application optimizes your Spotify playlists for smooth DJ transitions by:
- Analyzing tempo (BPM) and musical key of each track
- Using the Camelot Wheel system for harmonic mixing
- Reordering songs to minimize jarring transitions
- Supporting export back to Spotify-compatible CSV format

- **TSP-based optimization**: Traveling salesman problem approach for minimal transitions
- **2-opt improvement**: Local optimization for better results
